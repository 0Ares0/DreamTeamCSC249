Scrabble App

The app should be able to:
    - Check if any word is a valid scrabble word
    - Take a bunch of letters and return all valid words that can be formed from those letters
        * This function should have wildcard support
    - Add new words to the scrabble dictionary
    - Remove words from the scrabble dictionary
    - Do all of the above within a nice UI


We will be using a few data structures to handle those
